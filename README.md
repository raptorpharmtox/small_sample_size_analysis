# Small Sample Sizes Are Not Inherently Ethical

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that small sample sizes in toxicological studies are not inherently ethical. In other words, just because a study uses few animals does not mean it comports with the 3Rs principle of "Reduce". On the contrary, typically these small sample size studies are actually unethical.

The problem with these studies is that they lack any societal benefit. What does this mean? Well, put simply, small sample size studies tend to lack statistical power. Studies that lack statistical power lead to an increase in false positives -- that's right, they lead to inappropriately small p-values.

But what, you say, how is that? You're probably thinking that low statistical power means that the likelihood of committing a false negative is actually higher -- meaning, one is more likely to find the finding is not statistically significant when it should be. Right?

Well, as has been demonstrated in the Jupyter notebook in this repository, and by others, including Gelman and Carlin (http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691614551642), low power actually leads to increased false positives, too. 

The reason for this is simple -- sampling bias (again, see the Jupyter notebook for more details). Basically, when you are sampling only a few times from the distribution, you are increasing the likelihood of having biased samples. If you do this for your vehicle and treated groups, that's a recipe for disaster.

Thus, small sample size studies are going to be biased. If the study is biased, then it has very little utility to society. Why? Because the study is not likely reflecting the population's response -- what we are seeing is a reflection of the sampling error/bias. 

Given that environmental regulations must rely on the best avaialble science, these studies are not relevant for environmental regulations. If they are not relevant for environmental regulations, their utility for society is significant decreased. Furthermore, if the studies are biased, they are likely to mislead the overall scientific community -- potentially leading to inappropriate funding of certain scientific programs at the expense of more relevant areas. That is also not benefiting society. Thus, small sample size toxicology studies are simply not beneficial to society.

That benefit to society is critically important. When we consider the ethics of animal studies we are weighing the harms on the animals from the actual experiments and deprivation of rights against the higher value of societal beneficience. If that societal benficience is lost, then all that is left is the harms. Under the Principle of Harm, we must minimize or limit harm to others, including animals, as much as possible for our studies to be ethical. From an applied standpoint, without that beneficience, and only being left with harm, these small sample size animal studies are unethical.
